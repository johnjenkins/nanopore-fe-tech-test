# An Oxford Nanopore Frontend Technical Test

As part of our application process, we'd like you to demonstrate your talents with a small assignment. 
The task is useful for us to get an idea of your problem solving, organisation, eye-for-detail and overall thought processes. 

Please do not spend more than a few hours on it - we do not expect candidates to 'finish'; 
get as far as you like - enough to show us some of your talents - then within the interview, 
we'll talk through the work you've done and perhaps work some-more on it together. 

Please fork this project then when ready, send us (or your recruiter) a link to your forked repo for our review.

## The application

You are tasked with scaffolding a new customer facing application and adding it's first feature.

The application is a portal enabling customers to view and manage their orders, products and account information.
The portal's backend is a collection of microservices built at various times with various technologies.

The chosen technology stack is up to you, but you should be able to justify your decisions.

If you would like me to make a decision for you - just ask and I will scaffold something in a separate repo.

## The first feature

The first feature which you should deliver is a Customer / Account page:

### User story

- As a Nanopore Customer, I am a member of one or more Accounts.
- As an Account 'member' I can view other members within my Account.
- As an Account 'admin', I can view all other members and edit non Account 'leaders'.
- As an Account 'leader' I can view, edit, delete and invite new members to my Account.
- I want to be able to swap between my various Account views.

### Resources

Use the repo's 'design.png' to guide the look and feel.

Use the 'accounts' and 'customers' json schemas to make decisions about the app's organisation and to potentially mock out endpoints.

Make it responsive using your best judgement.

Any questions / clarifications can be sought from john.jenkins@nanoporetech.com and alberto.pena@nanoporetech.com

### On completion

Get as far as you reasonably can, then please fill in any next steps in the 'TODO.md' in this repo.
This should be all the tasks you would like to complete given more time, with justifications, ordered by priority.

We're reasonable people - we just want to see what you can do in the time you have :)
